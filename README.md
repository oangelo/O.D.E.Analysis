Ordinary Differential Equation Analysis
=======================================

This project intends to offer the time evolution of various models, and also some characteristics values or visualizations of the model. However, this project will not offer time series analysis tools, since here the focus are models. Nevertheless, these model may be very useful to generate data to test and develop time series analysis tools.

This lib has three numerical methods:
* Runge-Kutta, 4Th Order
* Adams-Bashforth, 4Th Order
* Adams-Moulton, 4Th Order

And offer these models:
* RÃ¶ssler Attractor
* Lorenz Attractor
* Double Pendulum

Code directives
===============
* The code should use Google C++ Style.
* For consistence, the code should only use these variable types: value, container and labels, defined on src/functions/functions.h

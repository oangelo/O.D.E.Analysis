Ordinary Differential Equation Analysis
=======================================

This project intends to offer the time evolution of various models, and also some characteristics values or visualizations of the model. However, this project will not offer time series analysis tools, since here the focus are models. Nevertheless, these model may be very useful to generate data to test and develop time series analysis tools.

This lib has three numerical methods:
* Runge-Kutta
* Adams-Bashforth
* Adams-Moulton

And offer these models:
* RÃ¶ssler Attractor
* Lorenz Attractor
* Double Pendulum

I'm developing this program as part of a Ph.D. in computational physics. Even though there are many tools that do the same, I'm using it to study how to develop numerical integration code that would be easy to extend and simple to use and understand. To do this, now I'm using polimorfism and templates and any C++ feature I may found convenient.
